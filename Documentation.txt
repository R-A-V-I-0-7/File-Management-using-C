This is a manual for the file AOSA.c

It is a modular program that accepts command line arguments to carry out tasks:


1. Manual:-

Name
        manual command_name

Description
        open the manual for the given command

2.Creation of a file
Name
        create FileName Mod(optional)

Type
        char*   FileName
        int     Mod

Default Value
        Mod     0660

Description
        create the file with name 'FileName' and mode 'Mod'

        'Mod' will specify the permissions of other, group and user; mod will be needed in octal value

        4: read permission
        2: write permission
        1: execute permission

        to give the permission of combo of any two or more permissions add the value corresponds to given permission

        Example
            0777 will give the all three permissions to all (user, groups and others)
            0421 will give read permission to user, write permission to group and execute permission to other

Note
        if file having name 'FileName' already exists it will give you the error message and further prompt you if you would want to replace the file with a new file.


3. Read:-

Name
        read FileName Bytes(optional) Offset(optional)

Type
        char*   FileName
        int     Bytes
        int     Offset

Default Value
        Bytes   -1
        Offset  0

Description
        will open the file 'Filename' and start reading it from offset 'Offset' upto 'Bytes' no of bytes.

        File which you want to read must already exist.

        If you don't know the number of bytes to be read and want to read the whole content upto end of file then skip the bytes part.


Name
        
        write FileName1 Offset1

Type
        char*   FileName1
        int     Offset1

Description
        will take the input from user and write it to file 'FileName1' at offset 'Offset1'

Note
        It will overwrite the content of FileName2.

        File in which you want to write must already exist.


5. Stats:-

Name
        stats FileName

Type
        char*   Filename

Description
        will show the stastical properties of file having name 'FileName'

Statstical Properties
        User ID
        File Size
        Number of Hard Links
        Inode Number
        Permissions of User, Group and Others


6. Copy:-

Name
        copy FileName1 Offset1 Bytes FileName2 Offset2

Type
        char*   FileName1
        char*   FileName2
	  int     bytes

Description
        Wrong number and type of argument will lead to undesirable result

Any other command other than those mentioned above will lead to a message and return:
	  Enter a valid operation from create, open, read, write, copy and info please :)


Hope this helps you to get a better understanding of this program ,enjoyed making my first modular program accepting command line arguments!!
